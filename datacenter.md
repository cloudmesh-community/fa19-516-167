## Carbon emission of a data center

**Data center:** Ashburn VA3

**Organization:** Raging Wire Data Centers

**Location:** Ashburn, Va

**Year Build:** 2017

**Electricity Cost ($/kW):**  $.0808/kWh

**IT Load (kW):**  16,000kW 

**Yearly Cost ($):**  $11,324,928 MM/yr

```
$11,324,928 MM/yr = [(16,000kW) * ($.0808/kWh) * (365 days) * (24 hours/day)]
```

**"Yearly CO2 Footprint(tons)":** ~75212 tons/yr

```
~75212 tons/yr = [(16,000kW) * (0.759 lbs/kWh) * (0.000707 metric tons CO2/kWh) * (365 days) * (24 hours/day)]
```

**CO2 equivalent in cars:** ~15969 cars

```
~15969 cars = (75212 tons/yr) / (4.71 metric tons CO2E/vehicle /year) 
```

## Wind Energy

Wind energy operates on the principle of using moving air (wind) to spin a propeller, which is connected to a rotor that turns the arm of a generator to produce electricity.

According to Sebastian Moss of DatacenterDynamics.com, Google and Facebook are partnering with Norwegian wind farms to help power their data centers. Additionally, Salesforce is partnering with a Canadian company to help power its data centers.
