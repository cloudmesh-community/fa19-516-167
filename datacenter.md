Carbon emission of a data center

## E.Datacenter.2.a - Ashburn VA3

* Data center:  Ashburn VA3  
* Organization:  Raging Wire Data Centers 
* Location:  Ashburn, Va 
* Year Build:  2017 
* Electricity Cost ($/kW):   $.0808/kWh 
* IT Load (kW):   16,000kW 
* Yearly Cost ($):   $11,324,928 MM/yr 



$11,324,928 MM/yr = (16,000kW) * ($.0808/kWh) * (365 days) * (24 hours/day)

**"Yearly CO2 Footprint(tons)":** ~75212 tons/yr

```
~75212 tons/yr = [(16,000kW) * (0.759 lbs/kWh) * (0.000707 metric tons CO2/kWh) * (365 days) * (24 hours/day)]
```

**CO2 equivalent in cars:** ~15969 cars

```
~15969 cars = (75212 tons/yr) / (4.71 metric tons CO2E/vehicle /year) 
```

## E.Datacenter.4 - Wind Energy

Wind energy operates on the principle of using moving air (wind) to spin a properller, which is connected to a
rotor that turns the arm of a generator to produce electricity.

According to Sebastian Moss of DatacenterDynamics.com, Google and Facebook are partnering with Norwegin wind farms
to help power its data centers. Additionally, Salesforce is partnering with a Canadian company to help power data centers.


##  E.Datacenter.5 - Rhode Island
In 2004, the Rhode Island's Renewable Energy Standard (RES) was established with the mission to produce 38.5% of the state's retail electricity sales from renewable resources by 2035. This includes electricity 
supplied by the state's retail electricity providers and non-regulated power producers and distribution companies.

Additionally, according to US EIA: "Rhode Island was the first state in the nation to implement an electricity restructuring plan, separating power generation from transmission and distribution, and the first operational offshore wind farm in the nation, the 30-megawatt, 5-turbine Block Island project" <sup>7</sup>

If Rhode Island power producers can stay on target with their annual renewable power supply targets and the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) confirms there is 
an adequate renewable energy supply, then by 2035 the state will have achieved its renweable energy goal.

##  E.Datacenter.8 - Wells Fargo data center outage

On February 7, 2019, Wells Fargo published a press release confirming a large-scale outage in one of its data 
centers which was initiated after smoke was detected following routine maintenance. According to the press release the impact of the outage affected the following services <sup>8</sup>:
